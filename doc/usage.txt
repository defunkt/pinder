User's guide
============

Pinder is a straightforward Python API to *script* Campfire_, the web 2.0 chat application kindly brought to us by the 37signals_ team.

Usage is all but rocket science so I'm gonna show you its full power in its simplicity. Thanks to `Brandon Keepers`_ for Tinder_.

Connect and login to the server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    >>> c = Campfire('subdomain')
    >>> c.login('john@doe.com', 'secret')

Any need to explain? I don't think so. We shall move on.

Find the proper room
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    >>> room = c.find_room_by_name('Jonz Room')

Only remember that *None* will be returned if you accidentally type in the wrong name. Ouch!

Poke with the room itself!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    >>> print room.users()
    set([u'Alice'])
    
As you can see you get back a **set** of the people talking about wild stuff in *Jonz Room*. You can also, while you are at it know the name of all the chatters in your Campfire subdomain::

    >>> print c.users()
    set([u'Alice', u'Bob'])

Seems Alice and Bob don't enjoy each other company any more! We don't like ladies to feel so alone so let's tell Alice she isn't::

    >>> room.speak("I'm working hard to get you out of there. Keep strong!")
    I'm working hard to get you out of there. Keep strong!
    
Then you can leave the room::

    >>> room.leave()
    
or destroy Alice hopes::

    >>> room.destroy()
    
and create your own love's nest::

    >>> c.create_room("Love's Nest", topic='No pun intended')
    
Room eavesdropping!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can peek inside the room reading the transcripts this way::

    >>> dates_of_transcripts = room.transcripts()
    >>> print room.transcript(dates_of_transcripts[0]) # last transcript
    [{'person': u'Bob B.', 'message': u'Are you spying on me?', 'user_id': u'1234567', 'id': u'19343281'}]
    
Logout
~~~~~~

When you are done playing you can simply logout::

    >>> c.logout()
    
and say farewell to Alice.

ps. I think we forgot about Bob, but who cares?

Extra
~~~~~

You can lock yourself in the room if you really want to but it's sad so I won't mention how to that. If you're absolutely certain about it go read the boring `API doc`_ where you can find other secret combos :-)
